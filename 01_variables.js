in javaScript we do't have to specify datatype while declaring the veriable.
variables in javaScript can be declared by three ways-

1. const - const keyword is used to declare constant variables which can not be chenged

2. let - let keyword is used to declare simple variables which can be changed as needed

3. var - var keyword is used to declare variables as globles means value of var variables can be changed from anywhere in the code this is not reccomnded today by most of the developers
